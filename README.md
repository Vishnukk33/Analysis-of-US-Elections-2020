## Features:


## Data Visualization and Analysis:

### Initialization and Preprocessing
Files and variables required for visualization were imported and declared in this section.
Reading of the input data as well as the preprocessing( segregation, ordering,etc) for it were carried out here.

### Visualization


<ol type="1">
  <li><h4>Total no. of tweets tweeted per day</h4></li>
    <img src="https://github.com/Vishnukk33/Twitter-Project/blob/master/Graphs/BarGraph_Demo1.png" width="400" height="400"/>
    <img src="https://github.com/Vishnukk33/Twitter-Project/blob/master/Graphs/BarGraph_Rep1.png" width="400" height="400"/>
  
  From the Above graphs we can tell that the total number of republican and democratic supporting tweets are almost comparable during the 5 days that we collected them. 
  
  
  <li><h4>No. of unique users tweeted per day</h4></li>

  From the Above graphs we can tell that the total number of UNIQUE republican and democratic users are almost comparable during the 5 days that we collected them.

1.Created a Twitter Streaming model to collect real-time tweets based on location and hashtags and stored the collected tweets in the local database as well as in the cloud.

2.Performed sentiment analysis, bot identification and visualization from the data obtained.

3.Developed a Stack based Machine Learning Algorithm to predict the political orientation of the tweet(Republican/Democratic).

4.Successfully tested the codes using a Kaggle Dataset. Currently, collecting real-time tweets to perform analysis.

5.All the API keys were changed for our privacy.

6.A proper documentation of the project would be uploaded once the project is completed.

7.The project was done together with Arun Kumar (https://github.com/Arun152k).
